## Basketball-Club-Database

Designing a Basketball club database with a large number of tables, with various connections between them.
with this database, I provided some queries for the common needs of the staff, when I divide the queries to a section of coaches queries, and manager queries


we have 3 files, the first one called 'create commands' that have the create and insert commands and create the database for any use.
the second file called queries has the answers for all of the common needs of the basketball club staff I could think of
, and the third file has all of the demands for the queries, for a better understanding
