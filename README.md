## Basketball-Club-Database

We have 4 files:

The first one called "Tables Creation", actually has the CREATE TABLE commands, and refers to the different data types.

The second file called INSERT refers to the data I chose to insert into the tables 

The third file called coach queries comprises the answers for all of the familiar needs of the basketball club staff I could think of, that one refers to the coaches queries

The fourth file includes the manager queries

The fifth file contains all of the demands for the queries, for better understanding.
